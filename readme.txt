Hex Battle:

    The objective is to use your pieces to eliminate all the enemy or capture their flag

Play guide:

    Soldiers (triangles) can move one space and shoot with a range of two spaces. Soldiers capture enemy pieces on their move.
    Tanks (squares) can move three spaces and shoot four spaces. Tanks can not capture like Soldiers do.
    Flags (pentagons) do not act. If your flag is captured by a Soldier, all of your pieces will change to the captor's side.
    Terrain (brighter or darker hexes) can not be used for movement by any troops.
